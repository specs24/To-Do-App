Programming a simple to do app

Two parts:

<b>DOM Scripting Part 1<b>
  
Using DOM elements to create events, event listeners, and event handlers. Buildindg simple to-do app to allow user create new to-dos and mark existing to-dos as complete with a checkbox.

<b>DOM Scripting Part 2<b>
  
Using DOM elements to create the state and UI, and how using both can improve the readability of code. Learned that approaching UI as a function of state can make our code easier to maintain and reuse.
